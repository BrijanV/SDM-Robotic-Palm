# SDM robotic palm controlled by hand gestures
---
-   In this course project we constructed a hand utilizing polymer-based Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) to operate in remote areas. The system proposed in this project has a five-finger configuration and each finger is modularized.
    
-   The SDM fingers are directly connected with servo motors, further all servo motors were commanded by microcontroller ATmega328 and controlled with the use of computer vision ( Media Pipe, a pre-trained Neural Network) to identify the hand joint coordinates.
